    class Student that defines a student by:
        (based on 12-student.py)

    Public instance attributes:
        first_name
        last_name
        age
    Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
    Public method def to_json(self, attrs=None):
    that retrieves a dictionary representation of a
    Student instance (same as 10-class_to_json.py):
        If attrs is a list of strings, only attributes name
        contain in this list must be retrieved.
        Otherwise, all attributes must be retrieved
    Public method def reload_from_json(self, json):
    that replaces all attributes of the Student instance:
        You can assume json will always be a dictionary
        A dictionary key will be the public attribute name
        A dictionary value will be the value of the public
        attribute
    You are not allowed to import any module

    Now, you have a simple implementation of a serialization
    and deserialization mechanism (concept of representation of
    an object to another format, without losing any information
    and allow us to rebuild an object based on this representation)
